This document outlines a blockchain-based smart contract model for managing digital advertisements while preventing fraud, all on the Archway network. It explains how the contract tracks ad impressions and stores immutable, tamper-proof records of ad views, ensuring transparent and trustworthy ad performance metrics. By integrating reward mechanisms, such as automatically distributing tokens to participants, and using batch operations for scalability, the system can handle large daily transaction volumes. The resulting continuous stream of ad-related transactions generates ongoing staking rewards through Archway’s incentives. This creates a positive feedback loop: the more active the ad ecosystem, the more the contract and its participants benefit from Archway’s reward pool, ultimately driving daily usage and encouraging long-term growth.
